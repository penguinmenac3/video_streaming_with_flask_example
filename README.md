## Video Streaming with Flask

### Description
Modified to support streaming out with webcams, and not just raw JPEGs.
Modified resolution to be smaller and better for realtime applications.

### Credits
Most of the code credits to Miguel Grinberg and log0, except that I made a small tweak. Thanks!
